2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place [church_admin type=address-list member_type_id=# map=1 photo=1] on the page you want the address book displayed, member_type=1 for members, map=1 toshow map for geocoded addresses. The member_type_id can be comma separated  e.g. member_type_id=1,2,3
4. Place [church_admin type=small-groups-list] on the page you want the small group list displayed
5. Place [church_admin type=small-groups ] on the page you want the list of small groups and their members displayed

7. Place [church_admin type=calendar category=# weeks=#] on the page you want a page per month calendar displayed
8. Place [church_admin type=calendar-list] on the page you want a agenda view calendar - option category and weeks options pastable from category admin page
9. There is a calendar widget with customisable title, how many events you want to show and an option for it to look like a post-it note
10. Place [church_admin_map member_type_id=#] to show a map of colour coded small groups - need to set a service venue first to centre map and geolocate member's addresses by editing them.
